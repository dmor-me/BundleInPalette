Bundle In Palette adds sixteen dyed variants of the vanilla bundle so you can color-code your inventory and storage.  
This mod **requires [Bundle In Creative](https://github.com/dmor-me/BundleInCreative)** (or any mod that restores the vanilla bundle recipe) so the new dyes have something to tint.

## Features
- 16 bespoke bundle textures covering every vanilla dye color.
- Shapeless recipes: combine one vanilla bundle with any dye to recolor it.
- Automatically injected into the Tools & Utilities creative tab.
- All bundles (vanilla + dyed) share the `forge:bundles` item tag for compatibility.
- Target platform: Minecraft **1.20.1** / Forge **47.x**.

## Crafting
```
Bundle + Any Dye -> Matching Dyed Bundle
```
Recipes unlock once you obtain at least one vanilla bundle.
